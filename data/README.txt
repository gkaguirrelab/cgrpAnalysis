The rodent action spectra CSV file was downloaded from:

	https://github.com/PySilentSubstitution/pysilsub/blob/main/pysilsub/data/rodent_action_spectra.csv

on May 17, 2023.

We believe that these values derive from those reported by Rob Lucas and colleagues. The data had previously been hosted on his personal website (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/robert.lucas/), but no longer seems available there.

SUVT Acrylic Transmission of 0.125 inch sheet 

The specifications of the transmission (%) of light as a function of wavelength of light (nm) was digitized from published information (jpeg file) on the materials used for the diffusion panel placed below each LED panel. The source of this graph is unclear upon review of emails. In the csv file, the first column lists the wavelength in nm, and the second column lists the transmission as a percentage.
