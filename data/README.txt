The rodent action spectra CSV file was downloaded from:

	https://github.com/PySilentSubstitution/pysilsub/blob/main/pysilsub/data/rodent_action_spectra.csv

on May 17, 2023.

We believe that these values derive from those reported by Rob Lucas and colleagues. The data had previously been hosted on his personal website (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/robert.lucas/), but no longer seems available there.
